- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
- [x] Scaffold the Project
- [x] Customize the Project
- [x] Install Required Extensions
- [x] Compile the Project
- [x] Create and Run Task
- [x] Launch the Project
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete

## Sample Files Created

The workspace now includes sample robot program files to test the extension:

- `sample_robot_pick_place.src` - KUKA KRL program file with pick and place logic
- `sample_robot_pick_place.dat` - KUKA KRL data file with positions and configurations  
- `sample_abb_welding.mod` - ABB RAPID welding program
- `sample_fanuc_assembly.ls` - FANUC AS assembly program

## Testing the Extension

1. Press F5 to launch the extension in debug mode
2. Open any of the sample robot files to test syntax highlighting
3. Try the robot connection commands from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
4. Test IntelliSense by typing robot commands in the sample files

## Project Features

The extension will provide:
- Syntax highlighting for robot programming languages (KRL, RAPID, AS, etc.)
- Device connection management for various robot brands
- Code completion and IntelliSense for robot commands
- Debugging capabilities for robot programs
- Project templates for different robot types
- Real-time robot status monitoring

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for extension development
- Follow VS Code extension best practices
- Support multiple robot programming languages
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
